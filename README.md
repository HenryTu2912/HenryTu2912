### Hi, I'm Henry Tu

I completed my studies in Computer System Technology at Saskatchewan Polytechnic; however, our program focused on software development at the beginning.  During my capstone project, I discovered a passion for web application development using the PERN stack and agile methodology, "LiveConnect Application". Subsequently, I served as an Applied Research Assistant for DICE - Saskatchewan Polytechnic, working as a full stack developer on a grain management application.

I am currently seeking a role in back-end web development, with a preference for working with C# or PHP. I am particularly interested in joining a startup with a close-knit team where I can quickly make a meaningful impact. If you have any job opportunities available, please reach out to me. Thank you!
